Scripts used in The SOD1-mediated ALS phenotype shows a decoupling between age of symptom onset and disease duration

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can be caused by variants in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. Most genotype-phenotype studies assess single variants or have small sample sizes. In this retrospective observational study, we analyse the age at symptom onset and time from onset to death or censor of SOD1-ALS patients by variant in an international population using Cox proportional hazards regression. Of variants with 10 or more cases, 16 of 26 are associated with younger age of onset (SOD1 ALS cases n=1122) and 9 of 21 have a different survival (SOD1 ALS cases n=883). Here we show the SOD1-mediated ALS phenotype is distinct from non-SOD1 ALS, and onset and survival are decoupled. Some variants are associated with a lower age of onset, others are associated with prognosis and age of onset.
